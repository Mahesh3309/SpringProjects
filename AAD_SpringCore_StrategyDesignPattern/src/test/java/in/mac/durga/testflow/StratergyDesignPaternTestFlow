Strategy Design Pattern:
	1)Prefer Composition(HAS-A) Avoid Inheritance(IS-A)
		Disadvantage of IS-A ---> we can not extend 2 class at a time.
	2)Always code interface and never code with Implementation
	3)Code Should be open to  extension and must be closed for modification.
		Make method as Final in inheritance implemented class.
